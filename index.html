    <h2><a href="https://powerrangers.fandom.com/wiki/Emily">Who is Emily?</a></h2>
    <p>Emily is a <em>sweet, innocent country girl</em> who was never supposed to be the Yellow Samurai Power Ranger. Emily was said to be a crybaby and was often picked on by her peers. It was her older sister, Serena, who was destined for the squad, but an illness forced Emily to take her place. Although she is a bit of a fish out of water, the passion of the team and the bustle of the city inspires Emily to train hard and make her sister proud. Emily says that she,<q>has a small crush on mike</q>, the green samurai ranger.</p>
