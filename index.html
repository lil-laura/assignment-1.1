            <p>Having grown up teased due to her tendency to cry, Emily tends to be shy around others. She suffers from a lack of self-confidence and as a result doesn't say much despite her desire to help those around her. Her sister Serena taught Emily how to de-sensitize herself to criticism. While the insults do hurt her, Emily is able to steel herself past all manner of degradation to achieve her current objective</p>
